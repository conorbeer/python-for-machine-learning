    "# Chapter 6 - Recommender System\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever wondered how different Netflix subscribers almost always find the movie or series that most interests them? Netflix’s recommender system is one of the most sophisticated recommender systems; it aims at finding personalized show recommendations with the minimum possible effort for the user.\n",
    "Netflix is not the only one to use recommender systems. Facebook, Amazon, YouTube, and even some online retailers are using highly complicated recommender systems in order to increase their sales by targeting each user with the product recommendation that most interests that user.\n",
    "Netflix’s recommender system increases the probability that a user would like a particular show based on three main factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "The user’s viewing history.\n",
    "\n",
    "What similar users have watched.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information about the movies themselves including title, genre, categories, actors, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of recommender systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation in any recommender system can be classified into three main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple recommendation: a generalized approach to non-personalized recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple recommender systems are non-personalized recommender systems that do not care for information about the user, the user’s behavioral patterns, or the user’s purchase history. These systems are mostly popularity-based in which the top recommendations are simply the highest rated or the most purchased item in the dataset. This is the reason the simple recommender system is also known as a popularity recommender system.\n",
    "One simple way to implement a popularity-based recommender system is to use maximum counts of ratings or purchases and always recommend the items with the highest count.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a movie recommender system as an example, a popularity-based recommender system would simply recommend the highest-rated movies.\n",
    "For an online store recommender system, a popularity-based recommender system would recommend the most purchased items.\n",
    "In this section, you do not need your computer. You will read and follow the example unless you want to run the code yourself step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content-based recommendation: recommendation based on the characteristics of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Content-based filtering recommenders are recommender systems that aim at recommending items based on their attributes and their characteristics.\n",
    "The item’s characteristics are described using a set of words. These words might occur frequently in the description of multiple items. If the profile of the user is built using the same words and using similarity measures, the similarity between different items could be calculated.\n",
    "The recommender system then chooses the item with the highest similarity measure.\n",
    "Click on the card to flip it and receive more detailed information about it. Click on the arrows to move on to the next card.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Term frequency**\n",
    "\n",
    "The total number of occurrences of a single word in multiple documents. It signifies the occurrence of the word in a document and gives higher weight when the frequency is greater. It is divided by document length to normalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inverse document frequency**\n",
    "\n",
    "The count of documents compared to the term frequency through all documents. This is one method used to give a higher weight to rare words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building a content-based recommender system\n",
    "\n",
    "The content of the movies in our dataset is written in the overview attribute:\n",
    "\n"

    "## Memory-based collaborative approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "A memory-based collaborative approach depends on using different methods of comparing users based on the interaction matrix directly, without using a latent model.\n",
    "If you do not understand what a latent model is, do not worry! It will be discussed more in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User-user method\n",
    "\n",
    "The user-user memory-based approach depends on identifying the most similar users based on their interaction history, then suggesting items to a specific user that are most common among the user’s neighbours, giving priority to items that this user has not interacted with before.\n",
    "\n",
    "To recommend an item to a specific user, you need to get the k-nearest neighbors of that user using some kind of a similarity measure that considers the similarity between two users who interacted with the same items in a similar manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "After computing the nearest neighbour, the system can recommend the most popular items among these neighbours that have not yet been referenced in the user’s interaction matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "User-user methods tend to have more personalized recommendations than item-item methods because they search the neighbourhood of similar users before recommending. However, the method has high variance. If the users most similar to this user have each only interacted with one other item, these uncommon items are highly weighted, making the recommendations’ variance considerably high.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Item-item method\n",
    "\n",
    "The item-item method depends on identifying similar items as items that most users have interacted with in a similar manner.\n",

    "The system recommends the user items similar to those the user has already interacted with positively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model-base collaborative approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Model-based collaborative approaches assume a latent–intermediate hidden model that explains the interactions in the user-item interaction matrices.\n",
    "One important example is the idea of matrix factorization. This depends on having an intermediate model that decomposes the sparse interaction matrices into two dense matrices\n",

    "\n",
    "You will use the Surprise library to implement a collaborative filter recommender system based on matrix factorization.\n",
    "Singular value decomposition (SVD) is one of the most common dimensionality reduction techniques available. It assumes that higher dimensional spaces could be represented by dense matrices in a lower dimensional space. So, singular value decomposition is one algorithm used to perform matrix factorization on user-item interaction matrices.\n",
    "In this section, you do not need your computer. You will read and follow the example unless you want to run the code yourself step by step.\n",
